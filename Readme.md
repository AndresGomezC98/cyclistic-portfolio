# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study 🚴‍♀️

This repository contains my case study for the **Google Data Analytics Capstone Project**.  
The analysis explores how **annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently**, with the goal of generating insights to design marketing strategies that convert casual riders into annual members.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `case_study/` → Final PDF, appendices, queries, and images.
- `sql/` → SQL scripts (table creation, data loading, and views).
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks (if used, optional).
- `assets/` → Supporting files (profile picture, etc.).

## 📑 Deliverables
- [Cyclistic Case Study PDF](case_study/cyclistic_case_study.pdf)  
- [Tableau Dashboards](dashboards_links.md)  

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Excel** for initial cleaning and transformations.  
- **MySQL** for database structuring and queries.  
- **Tableau** for dashboards and visualizations.  

## 📊 Key Insights
- Casual riders tend to take longer rides and ride more during weekends.  
- Annual members take shorter, more frequent rides, often during weekdays.  
- Promotions and campaigns should target weekends and casual riders’ behaviors to drive memberships.
